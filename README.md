# Problem 10 work
Here's a port of the chirper app over to Angular.  I've got it working with Google Firebase authentication.

*The authentication uses MY credentials in the environment variables.  Please be sure to change them to your own if you follow this approach.*

There will be more to come, next I'm going to integrate the "chirps" with the database.
